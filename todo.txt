Bonuses
Add a disabled attribute to buttons while their corresponding ajax request is still pending.

Add a genre property to every movie
Allow users to sort the movies by rating, title, or genre (if you have it)
Allow users to search through the movies by rating, title, or genre (if you have it)

Helpful Hints
The id property of every movie should not be edited by hand. The purpose of this property is to uniquely identify that particular movie. That is, if we want to delete or modify an existing movie, we can specify what movie we want to change by referencing it's id. When a new movie is created (i.e. when you send a POST request to /api/movies with a title and a rating), the server will respond with the movie object that was created, including a generated id.
Take a look at the other branches in this repository, as they have configuration/setup for common scenarios, such as including bootstrap in your application.
